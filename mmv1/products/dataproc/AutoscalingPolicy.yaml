      The policy id. The id must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_),

      3 and 50 characters.

    properties:
      - name: minInstances
        type: Integer
        default_value: 2
        description: |
          Minimum number of instances for this group. Bounds: [2, maxInstances]. Defaults to 2.
      - name: maxInstances
        type: Integer
        required: true
        description: |
          Maximum number of instances for this group.
      - name: weight
        type: Integer
        default_value: 1
        description: |
          Weight for the instance group, which is used to determine the fraction of total workers
          in the cluster from this instance group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2,
          and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers
          for each secondary worker.

          The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other
          autoscaling settings. For example, if maxInstances for secondary workers is 0, then only
          primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.

          If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for
          all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group
          within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight is set for one group only,
          the cluster will default to zero weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set
          only on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers only and no secondary workers.

        description: |
          Duration between scaling events. A scaling period starts after the

            description: |
              Timeout for YARN graceful decommissioning of Node Managers. Specifies the
              duration to wait for jobs to complete before forcefully removing workers
              (and potentially interrupting jobs). Only applicable to downscaling operations.

              Bounds: [0s, 1d].
          - name: scaleUpFactor
            type: Double
            required: true
            description: |
              Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
              add workers. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there
              is no pending memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
              A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up
              (less aggressive scaling).

              Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
          - name: scaleDownFactor
            type: Double
            required: true
            description: |
              Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
              remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there
              is no available memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
              A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for
              autoscaling a single job.

              Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
          - name: scaleUpMinWorkerFraction
            type: Double
            default_value: 0.0
            description: |
              Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling
              occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler
              must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of
              0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.

              Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.
          - name: scaleDownMinWorkerFraction

            description: |
              Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs.
              For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must
              recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0
              means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.
