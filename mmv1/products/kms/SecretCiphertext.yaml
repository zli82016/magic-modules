description: |
  Encrypts secret data with Google Cloud KMS and provides access to the ciphertext.


  ~> **NOTE:** Using this resource will allow you to conceal secret data within your
  resource definitions, but it does not take care of protecting that data in the
  logging output, plan output, or state output.  Please take care to secure your secret
  data outside of resource definitions.
